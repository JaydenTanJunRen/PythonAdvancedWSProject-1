## Overview

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, an RGB LED keypad to create a medication schedule reminder system. It reminds users to take their medication at specific times, allows them to confirm medication intake, and provides a stress-relief feature by teaching a simple melody on the keypad.
